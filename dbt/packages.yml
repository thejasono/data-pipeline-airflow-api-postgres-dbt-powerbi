# packages.yml lists external dbt packages (macros, models) that this project depends on.  
# Running `dbt deps` installs them under `dbt_packages/`, each with its own `dbt_project.yml`.  
# These package configs donâ€™t override your main project; they just provide additional features.
packages:
  - package: dbt-labs/dbt_utils    # Community-maintained helper macros and tests
    version: [">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"]  # Pin to major version 1.x for compatibility
